In this project let's build a **Movies App** by applying the concepts we have learned till now. This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.

You will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a class component, displaying that data, using **component lifecycle** methods, **routing** concepts, **authentication**, and **authorization**, and adding responsiveness to the website.
